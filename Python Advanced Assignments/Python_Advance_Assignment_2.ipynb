    "The relationship between classes and modules in Python can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Python class is like a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of objects that are instantiated from the class. Classes contain attributes (data members) and methods (functions) that are specific to the class and its instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A module in Python is a file with a '.py' extension that contains Python code, including class definitions, functions, and variables. Modules serve as a way to organize and reuse code. They can contain one or more classes, making classes part of a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classes and modules are related in that classes can be defined within modules, allowing us to organize and encapsulate related code into separate modules. We can then import and use these classes from the modules in other Python programs to access their functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modules provide a way to modularize and structure code, while classes provide a blueprint for creating objects with specific attributes and behaviors. Classes can be seen as a more detailed and structured way of organizing data and functions within a module."
