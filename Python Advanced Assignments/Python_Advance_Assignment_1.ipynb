    "The purpose of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Structuring Programs: OOP provides a means of structuring programs by bundling properties and behaviors into individual objects. This allows for a more organized and modular approach to software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Real-World Entities: OOP aims to implement real-world entities, such as objects, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, in the programming. This makes it easier to model and work with real-world concepts in software.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data and Functions Binding: OOP binds data and the functions that operate on that data together as a single unit (an object). This concept of encapsulation helps ensure that the data is not directly accessible or modifiable from outside the object, promoting data integrity and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Advantages: OOP provides several advantages, including:\n",
    "1.) Division of programs into smaller, manageable segments using objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) Easier maintenance and modification of existing code due to the modular nature of OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) The ability to create multiple instances (objects) of a class, allowing for the reuse of code and efficient modeling of similar entities."
