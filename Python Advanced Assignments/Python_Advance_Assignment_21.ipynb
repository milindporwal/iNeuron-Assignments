    "Ans. A probability distribution characterizes the pattern in which a random variable's values are spread out. It provides insights into the likelihood of the random variable assuming different values, indicating which values are more probable and which are less so. By examining past data and the frequency of the random event, we can estimate future outcomes in terms of probabilities."
