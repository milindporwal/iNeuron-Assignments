    "- A binary file contains raw data in the form of bytes or a compiled version of a text file.\n",
    "- When a file is opened in binary mode by appending 'b' to the mode string (e.g., 'rb' for reading in binary mode), reading its data does not decode it in any way.\n",
    "- Reading from a binary-mode file returns the content as a bytes object, preserving the data in its raw, unchanged form.\n",
    "- Writing to binary-mode files takes bytes data and transfers it to the file without any encoding or decoding.\n",
