    "- Configuration Files: Text files are often used for configuration files (e.g., INI files) that are easy to edit manually and contain human-readable settings.\n",

    "- Scripting and Code: Source code files, script files, and markup languages (like HTML and XML) are typically stored as text files because they need to be human-readable and editable.\n",

    "- Endianness: The endianness (byte order) of the system can affect how integers are stored in binary form. If we write an integer on a system with one endianness and read it on a system with a different endianness, the integer may be interpreted incorrectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Platform Dependence: Writing integers directly in binary can lead to platform-dependent files. A file written on one system may not be correctly read on another system with different integer representations or sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Size: Integers can vary in size (e.g., 32-bit or 64-bit) depending on the system and Python version. Writing integers in binary without considering their size can lead to issues when reading them on a different platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Portability: Binary representations may not be portable across different Python versions or implementations. Code that writes binary integers may not work as expected in all environments"
