    "A NumPy array and a Pandas DataFrame are both data structures used in Python for handling and analyzing data, but they have distinct differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy Array:\n",
    "- Homogeneous: NumPy arrays store homogeneous data, meaning elements must be of the same data type (e.g., integers, floats).\n",
    "- Multi-dimensional: NumPy supports multi-dimensional arrays, which are efficient for numerical computations.\n",
    "- Limited labels: NumPy arrays primarily rely on integer indexing for accessing elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas DataFrame:\n",
    "- Heterogeneous: Pandas DataFrames store heterogeneous data, allowing different data types in each column.\n",
    "- Tabular structure: DataFrames represent data in a tabular structure, similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table.\n",
    "- Rich labels: Columns and rows in DataFrames can have labels, making it more suitable for real-world data with labeled dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can convert between NumPy arrays and Pandas DataFrames using the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To convert a NumPy array to a Pandas DataFrame, we can use the pd.DataFrame() constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: df = pd.DataFrame(numpy_array).\n",
    "\n",
    "- To convert a Pandas DataFrame to a NumPy array, we can use the .to_numpy() method on the DataFrame.\n",

    "- Invalid Symbol: Users might enter an invalid or non-existent stock symbol. To handle this, we can implement error checking and provide appropriate feedback to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Different Exchanges: Stock symbols can be traded on different exchanges, each with its own symbol format.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Availability: Not all stock symbols have publicly available data. Some stocks may be less traded or not supported by the data source our application uses.\n",

    "- Data Retrieval Issues: The data source we rely on may experience outages or delays in data retrieval.\n",

It represents the average value of a specific data series, such as a stock's closing prices, over a 180-day period. The moving average is calculated by summing the values of the data series over the past 180 days and then dividing that sum by 180. This process is repeated for each day, creating a new average value each day as the time window \"moves.\""
