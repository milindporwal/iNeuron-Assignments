    "Ans. Compound interest is advantageous because it allows our initial investment or principal to grow exponentially over time. When interest compounds, we earn interest not just on our initial investment but also on the interest that has already been added. This compounding effect results in a higher return on our investment in the long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, a higher rate of simple interest that does not compound means that we only earn interest on our initial investment each period. With simple interest, the growth of our investment is linear and doesn't have the same exponential growth potential as compound interest.\n",

    "So, the benefit of compound interest is that it enables our money to grow faster and accumulate more wealth over time compared to a higher simple interest rate."
