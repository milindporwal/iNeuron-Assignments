    "Exception processing in programming is essential for handling errors and exceptional conditions during program execution.\n",
    "Here are three key applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception processing is used to validate user inputs and ensure they meet specified criteria. It helps programs gracefully handle invalid inputs by providing meaningful error messages or requesting users to re-enter data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mathematical Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "It catches exceptions in mathematical operations, preventing issues like division by zero. For example, it gracefully handles errors like ZeroDivisionError to avoid program crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- File Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception processing is crucial for file operations, such as opening or writing to files. It allows programs to respond to errors like missing files or permission issues, ensuring the program doesn't crash and providing error details for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception processing enhances program robustness, enabling the handling of unexpected issues without abrupt termination, improving the user experience, and facilitating debugging and maintenance."
