    "A metaclass in Python is a class that defines the behavior of other classes. It's a class for classes, essentially. Here are some key points about metaclasses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Defining Class Behavior: Metaclasses allows us to define how a class behaves. They determine the structure and attributes of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instances of Metaclasses: A class is an instance of a metaclass. In Python, every class is derived from a metaclass. The default metaclass for most classes is the built-in 'type' metaclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Custom Metaclasses: We can create custom metaclasses to modify class creation, control attributes, or add specific behavior to classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Type Metaclass: The 'type' metaclass is the metaclass for all classes. When we create a new class, we are creating an instance of the 'type' metaclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Advanced Use Cases: Metaclasses are a powerful and advanced feature of Python. They are often used in frameworks and libraries to enforce coding standards, add functionality, or customize class behavior."
