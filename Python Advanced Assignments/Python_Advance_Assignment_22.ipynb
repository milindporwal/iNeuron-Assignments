    "Benefits of using the built-in array package :\n",
    "\n",
    "- Typed Arrays: The array module allows us to create arrays with elements of a specific data type, such as integers, floating-point numbers, or characters. This can lead to more efficient memory usage and performance compared to regular Python lists, which can hold elements of different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memory Efficiency: Since array objects store elements of a consistent data type, they can be more memory-efficient than lists, which may need to store additional type information for each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Performance: When working with large datasets, array objects can be faster than lists, as they offer more efficient memory usage and access times.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fixed Data Type: The data type of elements in an array is fixed when the array is created, which can help ensure data consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interoperability: The array module provides a way to read and write binary data files, which can be useful for data storage and exchange between different programs or platforms."
